  <h1>Important Information Please Read it</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Are you buying an oxygen concentrator for someone with covid there's alot
      of misinformation and its hard to weed out the ringht info under pressute
    </li>

    <li>
      Please amplif this crowdsourced info -it's verified.You could save a life!
    </li>

    <li>Note: this is about O2 concentrators NOT cylinders</li>

    <li>1.Ensure the cencentrator has high flow rate.10 L is great</li>
    <li>
      2.Buy the "90%±3%" concentration output ,not "30-90±%". Very very
      important.
    </li>
    <li>
      3.Do NOT buy Dedakj (not for COVID!)&Phillips 3ltr (pretty useless).Go for
      airsep or phillips 5l -both work
    </li>
    <li>4.Certification matters.</li>
    <li>
      6.If you'r using US oxygen concentrator ,they're only 110V.You will need a
      transformer to step it up to 230V.
    </li>
    <li>
      7.Please watch out for this: sellers cant try to fool you with high prices
      by highlighting 5ltr,8ltr,10ltr flow rates.THIS IS NOT ENOUGH.Ensure
      output of 90%(±3%) concentration of oxygen .This high percentage really is
      the need of the hour
    </li>
    <li>
      8.Lastly concentrators that do not fulfil these conditions are less ideal
      for covid cases.But,if there is no other option,other concentrators still
      save lives by providing patients the necessary relief -so please purchase
      them if all else fails
    </li>
    <li>Take care of yourself and your loved ones :)</li>
    <li>
      9.Final note on prices:this is important; do NOT assume that more
      expensive means better quality.Many cheap concentrators can be good and
      exprensive once can be rubbish .refer to all the above notes and ensure
      they are met.concentrators usually cost between Rs 40K-90K
